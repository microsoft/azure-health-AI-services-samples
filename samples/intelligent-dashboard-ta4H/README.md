# Intelligent Dashboard powered by Text Analytics for Health

The Intelligent Dashboard is designed to help healthcare professionals and organizations efficiently gather insights from unstructured healthcare information. By utilizing [Text Analytics for Health](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-health-insights), the sample is able to receive unstructured healthcare information and receive structured insights. The insights generated from Text Analytics for Health are then used to create population insights dashboards, which are accessible in a single PowerApp. With this innovative sample, healthcare professionals can easily access and analyze data in real-time. Say goodbye to the tedious process of manually analyzing healthcare data and hello to our Intelligent Dashboard  sample!

## Architecture
!["A diagram of the Intelligent dashboard architecture"](/media/intelligent-dashboard-ta4h/Architecture.png)

### Architecture Flow
1. Upload one or more documents via the Power App.
2. The document(s) are uploaded to a Azure Storage Account
3. The Azure Function picks up the uploaded text files
4. The Azure Function sends the unstructured documents to Text Analytics for Health for processing
5. The results, in FHIR format, are being pushed to the Azure Health Data Service
6. The PowerBI provides insights from the unstructured data, via the FHIR connector

# Getting started

## Setup Azure Resources

### Creating an App Registration

**Before Deploying to Azure:**
1. Go to "Azure Active Directory"
2. Click App registrations
3. Create new registration
4. Create new secret
5. Copy ClientID and ClientSecret for the deployment step in Azure
